legs can break when shot -> crawling
legs getting hit by high damage -> chance of stumble
body getting hit by high damage -> low chance of stun
head getting hit by high damage -> chance of stun

TOP PRIORITY BASICS:
stumble
	-zmb move speed briefly slowed down
	-body doubles over to regain balance
stun
	-zombie is hit by brief pushing force on the top of its body
	-wavers back and forth to try and not fall backwards
crawling
	-zombie has broken/missing legs
	-crawls at 1/3 speed

SECOND PRIORITY:
burning
	-deals fire damage when attacking
	-shakes off the fire after a brief time, giving a speed boost as it shakes
enraged
	-occurs after a headshot stun
	-zombie charges forward a set distance
