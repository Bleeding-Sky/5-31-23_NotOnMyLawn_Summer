Obj_TacviewTracker
	CONFIG
		anchorObject
			(optional)
			the anchor object: an object present in both views
			that is used to sync the positions. if this is NOT
			null, then anchorPos is set to its position in the
			Start method
		anchorPos
			the position that anchors both views together.
			unneeded if an anchor object is set

	calculates displacements
		displacement = object position - anchor position
		basically the x and y coords with respect to the anchor


Obj_WindowTracker
	CONFIG
		tacviewTrackerScript (WindowTracker ONLY)
			reference to the corresponding TacviewTracker script 
			on the object's Tacview counterpart
		anchorObject
			(optional)
			the anchor object: an object present in both views
			that is used to sync the positions. if this is NOT
			null, then anchorPos is set to its position in the
			Start method
		anchorPos
			the position that anchors both views together.
			unneeded if an anchor object is set

	matches tacview counterpart's position
		reads the X and Y displacements of tacview,
		then translates those displacements to X and Z displacements,
		and sets the object's position to those X and Z displacements
		relative to the anchor's position,
		Y is set to 0(floor level)
