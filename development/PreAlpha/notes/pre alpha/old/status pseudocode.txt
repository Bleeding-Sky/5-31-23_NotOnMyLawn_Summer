-repeat with dostun, endstun, and docrawl methods. eventually these will start animations, change sprites, do effects

limb health SO
	float headMaxHealth
	float torsoMaxHealth
	float legMaxHealth

start: getting the limb health from the SO
	headHealth = zmbHealthSO.headMaxHealth
	torsoHealth = zmbHealthSO.torsoMaxHealth
	legHealth = zmbHealthSO.legMaxHealth

doHeadDamage(float damageVal)
	{
		headHealth -= damageVal;
		//if damage big enough, do stun
	}
-repeat with other limbs. legs have notes on stumble and crawl activation, etc

void doOverallDamage(damageVal)
	{
		overallHealth -= damageVal;
	}
-leg damage is halved, head damage is 1.5'd
-those limb damage methods use global headDmgMultiplier and legDmgMultiplier vars
