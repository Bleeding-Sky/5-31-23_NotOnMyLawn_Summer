current implementation:
each scene's zombie has damage regions
all damage detectors have ref to master script

-what is the purpose of the master script?
	-masterscript MUST handle stumble/crit calculations AND destroying
	zmbs on death
	-also handles any other info like damage levels on different limbs
	or status effects (stumbling bleeding etc)
		-should be held as states
	-MAYBE RENAME TO ZMB_STATUSMANAGER? since it keeps track of the status

headshots on different scenes SHOULD be handled exactly the same
	-master should be a damage manager? since it no longer handles any
	tracking
	-would then handle all damage calcs and kill zombies on death
		-needs reference to each view of said zombie to destroy them
		on death
		-tacview should link window zombie to master when creating it
conclusion: make master script a damage manager. would require some refactoring
	to get necessary references (listed above)

REVIEW:
what does each zombie view need?
	-tacview
		-pathing
		-trap damage detector
	-window
		-body region damage detectors
	-indoor
		-pathing
		-body region damage detectors
	TODO: test making all views of zombies children of the master
	(ADDED TO GITHUB PROJECT)
		-see if they move the whole object
		-see if master can fetch damage detector scripts

NEXT JOB: (ADDED TO GITHUB PROJECT)
-can this be simplified with a damageReporter script for each scene?
	-LEARN EVENT SYSTEM: each detector should raise an event, master could
	read those events??????????
	-DID NOT END UP DOING THIS
