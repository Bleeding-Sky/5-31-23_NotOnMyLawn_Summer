add window tracker script on an empty object
create a child object that has a sprite renderer AND a boxcollider2d
	-MAKE SURE SPRITE IS CENTERED
	-do this by setting the parent position to (0,0,0) before creating sprite child object
	
set the windowTracker script's "sprite child object" field to the child object with the spriterenderer and boxcollider

if its not centered then the sprite won't spawn at the right height in the window view
